# Ruby - guests-to-tables generator

Welcome to guests list generator.

This program gets to inputs:
 - guests number
 - tables number
 With those data it calculates three different combinations that assigns guests to seats at tables for each of three meals served during your party. Main purpose of implemented logic was to let every single guest eat meals with as many other guest as it is possible.

 For first meal program is just split all guests between tables.

 Second comination is based on logic that tries to place guests from each previous table to as many other tables as it is possible.

 Guests list for last meal is generated by comparing random guests-to-table combination with previous combinations. If that random combination will match for too many guests a loop breaks and tries again with another random combination. Program stops when all tables are filled.
